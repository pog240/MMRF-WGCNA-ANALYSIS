# MMRF-WGCNA-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on understanding the molecular mechanism behind early multiple myeloma (MM)progression in newly diagnosed 270 Multiple Myeloma patients who were treated early with MM standard therapies: lenalidomide, bortezomide and dexamethasone (RVD).

This project is with the assuption that you have cleaned your expression data; otherwise, this code did not cover data prep. 
For data prep you will need another set of code for that purpose. 

#Project Ojective
The objectives of this project are:
* identify and bridge the gab in racial disparity in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma
* I dentofy hub genes can help in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma


# Partners
* Morehouse School of Medicine depatment of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology
* Emory School of Medicine, Winship cancer institute, Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, GA.
* Emory University School of Medicine, Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA
* Georgia Institute of Technology department of applied system engineering, Atlanta, GA.

Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visulization

# Technologies
* R
* Python
* kmploter
* ROC
* Cytoscape

#System Requirements 
* Most of the current new OS will work
* Minimum RAM required 16GB

Getting Started
* Dwnload a secondary expression data for MM samples and prep it before using this WGCNA code
* Downloa the clinical data for the samples
