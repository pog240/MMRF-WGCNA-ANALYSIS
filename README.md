# MMRF-WGCNA-ANALYSIS
This project focuses on 270 Multiple Myeloma patients who were diagnosed early and received standard treatment (RVD)

This project is with the assuption that you have cleaned your expression data; otherwise, this code did not cover data prep. 
For data prep you will need another set of code for that purpose. 

#Project Ojective
The objectives of this project are:
* identify and bridge the gab in racial disparity in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma
* I dentofy hub genes can help in the treatment of Multiple Myeloma


# Partners
* Morehouse School of Medicine depatment of Microbiology, Biochemistry, and Immunology
* Emory University depatment of --- and ---
* Georgia Institute of Technology department of ---

Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visulization

# Technologies
* R
* Python
* kmploter
* ROC
* Cytoscape

#System Requirements 
* most of the current new OS will work
* Minimum RAM required 16GB

Getting Started
* Dwnload a secondary expression data for MM samples and prep it before using this WGCNA code
* Downloa the clinical data for the samples
